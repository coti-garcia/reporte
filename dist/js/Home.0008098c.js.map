El norte de nuestro Centro siempre ha estado claro: “brindar soluciones tecnológicas basadas en ciencia al mercado y a la sociedad”.\r\n</p>\r\n          <p>Fue a inicios de 2015 cuando nuestras actividades comienzan de forma “novedosa” en estrecha relación con la industria vitivinícola del país. Para esto, un grupo multidisciplinario (Estado, academia e industria) viaja a California para dar forma a nuestra primera hoja de ruta de trabajo técnico. Una “inmersión” en el trabajo de investigación que nuestra universidad en California, University of California, Davis, estaba haciendo en ese entonces para apoyar el desarrollo de la viticultura y enología del estado. La biotecnología y la agricultura inteligente, aplicadas de forma metódica y sistemática para enfrentar desafíos reales de la industria Californiana, fueron las primeras ventanas de la relación ciencia - industria que se abren como un modelo a observar y adaptar cautelosamente desde Chile.\r\nEsta ha sido una experiencia abierta a todos, parte o no del proyecto original, desde la industria hasta la academia, pasando por las instituciones del Estado.\r\n</p>\r\n          <p>Después de casi seis años, vemos cómo el quehacer de UC Davis Chile se ha basado en tres pilares fundamentales:\r\n\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Estrecha colaboración con las instituciones de I+D chilenas.</li>\r\n            <li>Incorporación activa de las empresas receptoras de las soluciones en nuestras actividades.</li>\r\n            <li>Transferencia efectiva de la experiencia de nuestra Universidad, aciertos y errores, actuando como un puente tecnológico desde California a Chile.</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>Si bien partimos con un modelo relativamente simple, que asume un desarrollo de tecnología que es rápidamente incorporado por la industria, este fue adaptado en nuestros primeros años para ajustarse a los requerimientos de Chile, su cultura, sus instituciones, sus necesidades y carencias. Desde la industria vitivinícola crecimos a un trabajo más amplio en Agricultura, Alimentos y Medio Ambiente. Identificamos que la adopción tecnológica es un proceso lento que requiere más que sólo I+D, por lo que trabajamos fuertemente en fortalecer los procesos de Transferencia Tecnológica y Extensión, especialmente este último.</p>\r\n          <p>Hemos crecido en nuestra red de colaboración tanto académica como empresarial y pública, lo que muestra nuestro tremendo compromiso con los socios estratégicos de UC Davis Chile.</p>\r\n          <p>Este documento es una recopilación de nuestras actividades durante nuestros casi seis años de vida en Chile. Pretende, además, mostrar con hechos y acciones la evolución de nuestro trabajo y convertirse en un hito de reflexión para los desafíos que enfrentaremos en el futuro. Estos, como siempre, requieren de un trabajo conjunto entre la academia, el sector público y la industria. Para esto UC Davis Chile sigue trabajando en compartir la experiencia de California y su red internacional, fortaleciendo los procesos de I+D, Transferencia Tecnológica y Extensión. </p>\r\n          <p>Esperamos que este documento sea una “muestra” de lo que podemos lograr en forma colaborativa para impulsar el desarrollo económico y social de Chile.</p>\r\n          <div class=\"testimonial-slider__author\">\r\n            <h6 class=\"name bodega\">Dr. Mauricio Cañoles</h6>\r\n            <div class=\"designation\">General Manager</div>\r\n            <div class=\"designation\">UC Davis Chile</div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>  \r\n      <div class=\"row carta-wrapper carta-2 section-space--pt_120 section-space--pb_60\">\r\n                <div class=\"col-12\">\r\n        <h3 class=\"subtitle text-left mb-5 arboretum\">LA COLABORACIÓN COMO MOTOR</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-md-3 col-lg-2 author\">\r\n          <div class=\"testimonial-slider-side-info\">\r\n            <img\r\n                src=\"@/assets/img/team/Lovell_Tu_Jarvis.jpg\"\r\n                class=\"img-fluid\"\r\n                alt=\"\"\r\n             />\r\n            <div class=\"quote-icon\"><i class=\"fas fa-quote-left gold\"></i></div>\r\n            <div class=\"testimonial-slider__author\">\r\n                <span class=\"bodega quote\"> Con un enfoque en la agricultura y el medio ambiente, el Centro ha contribuido al bienestar de Chile y esperamos ampliar nuestras colaboraciones y contribuciones mutuamente beneficiosas.\"</span>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-md-9 col-lg-10 text-carta\">\r\n              <p>La Universidad de California, Davis, es una de las grandes\r\nuniversidades públicas de Estados Unidos, dedicada a entregar educación, investigación y servicios de excelencia a la sociedad. \r\n</p>\r\n              <p>UC Davis tiene una larga y fructífera trayectoria de colaboración con instituciones chilenas. Por ejemplo, un gran número de científicos chilenos vinculados a agronomía estudiaron en UC Davis en los años sesenta. Al regresar a Chile, estos científicos desempeñaron un papel clave en el desarrollo de la industria chilena de la fruta fresca, convirtiéndola en la potencia que es hoy. Las conexiones que el sector agrícola chileno forjó con UC Davis en aquel momento siguen vigentes y hoy están cada vez más activas.</p>\r\n              <p>UC Davis creó el Centro de Innovación de las Ciencias de la Vida (también conocido como Centro de Innovación UC Davis Chile) en 2015, con la asistencia de CORFO, con el fin de realizar investigaciones innovadoras y lograr la transferencia de tecnología en colaboración con socios académicos e industriales de Chile. El Centro facilita el acceso de los chilenos a la experiencia y los conocimientos de California, los cuales a menudo son muy relevantes para Chile debido a las muchas similitudes entre las dos regiones, por ejemplo, en términos de su geografía, clima, industrias, sociedad, y universidades.  A menudo los descubrimientos científicos y las nuevas tecnologías desarrolladas en California son aplicables a Chile con relativamente pocos ajustes, y viceversa. Aprendemos y nos beneficiamos el uno del otro.</p>\r\n              <p>UC Davis Chile busca soluciones que beneficien a los productores y consumidores de Chile a través de la creación de nuevas tecnologías y mejores políticas públicas. Trabajamos estrechamente con agencias del Gobierno Chileno y colaboramos con socios universitarios chilenos. Con un enfoque en la agricultura y el medio ambiente, el Centro ha contribuido al bienestar de Chile a través de muchos proyectos, por ejemplo, algunos vinculados a la genómica y control de enfermedades en plantas, como también a la mejora de la gestión del riego en viñedos; el desarrollo de un programa de extensión exitoso para pequeños y medianos productores de vino, y la creación de un sitio de web de extensión integral del vino. En otro proyecto, el Centro está desarrollando un sitio web público para informar a los usuarios sobre la disponibilidad de agua en la cuenca del río Aconcagua. Asimismo, estamos desarrollando modelos matemáticos para demostrar el impacto de los contaminantes y el cambio climático sobre la calidad del agua lacustre, entregando la información necesaria a los formuladores de políticas para diseñar\r\npolíticas públicas que sostengan estos ambientes lacustres en el tiempo.\r\n</p>\r\n              <p>Más recientemente, trabajando con agencias gubernamentales adicionales y a través de mayores lazos con universidades chilenas, hemos ampliado las colaboraciones en áreas como la gestión de la calidad del aire, la infraestructura pública para apoyar la adopción de vehículos eléctricos y de hidrógeno, mayores beneficios de la telemedicina, la adopción de tecnología de iluminación mejorada, y el aumento de ahorros a través de un enfoque en la economía circular.</p>\r\n              <p>UC Davis Chile está desarrollando colaboraciones académico-científicas que contribuyen al desarrollo económico y social del país. Estamos encantados de estar en Chile. Esperamos ampliar nuestras colaboraciones y contribuciones mutuamente beneficiosas en los próximos años.</p>\r\n              <p>Sinceramente,</p>\r\n               <div
